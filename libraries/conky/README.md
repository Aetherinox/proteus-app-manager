# What Is This Folder?
This folder contains numerous subfolders
- `Conky Base`
- `Conky Manager`

If you use to modify your desktop using config files and manual edits, then you only need `Conky Base`. However, if you wish to have a GUI front-end which allows you to manage your themes, you will need `Conky Base` + `Conky Manager`.
